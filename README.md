# Palomino
Palomino is a tiny implementation of a neural network to predict chances of mortality if a patient undergoes a lung resection surgery.

There have been only few reports regarding long-term survival post lung cancer surgery. The parameters which influence survival rates are not fully understood. Some suggest that hospitals with greater surgical volumes enhance survival rates. Many point to age and pulmonary function as important predictors in mortality rates.

Palomino uses reverse backpropagation algorithm to accurately predict the chances of mortality in a patient is subjected to lung resection surgery. The data set was collected retrospectively at Wroclaw Thoracic Surgery Centre for patients who underwent major lung resections for primary lung cancer in the years 2007-2011. The Centre is associated with the Department of Thoracic Surgery of the Medical University of Wroclaw and Lower-Silesian Centre for Pulmonary Diseases, Poland, while the research database constitutes a part of the National Lung Cancer Registry, administered by the Institute of Tuberculosis and Pulmonaryn Diseases in Warsaw, Poland. The data set includes details of 470 patients and 16 parameters including the post-one-year survival status.

Palomino further provides a user interface for prospective patients to use a pre-compiled network to make an informed decision regarding whether they would like to undergo lung resection surgery or not.
